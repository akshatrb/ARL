5V Relay Module-
A 5V Relay Module is used in this project which helps the microcontroller to operate high voltage AC loads like a light. 
It consists of a 5V Electromechanical Relay, transistor, two resistors and two diodes.


16x2 LCD Display-
A simple LCD module will be employed to display textual information. It will be interfaced with the microcontroller and 
will be powered with a 5V DC supply.

C8051F340 Microcontroller-
An 8 bit microcontroller manufacture by Silicon Labs. The MCU includes a powerful 8051 core with 50 MHz performance 
along with 64 kB Flash, 4.25 kB RAM.

IR Sensor Module-
IR Sensor will objectively sense Mass. It senses presence of a physical body by either emitting or detecting infrared radiation. 
We have used reflective type IR sensor modules in this project. It consists of 3 components: an IR Transmitter (IR LED), an IR 
Receiver (like a Photo Diode) and a signal processing circuit (LM358 op-amp). These modules will draw 5V of power from the 
DC battery and they will be connected to PORT2 pins i.e. P2.0 and P2.1 of the microcontroller. Sensor will sense presence of
Mass and convey it to the microcontroller which in turn will initiate the lamp. The IR sensor is a digital sensor, thus it’s output 
will either be 0 (object detected) or 1 (no detection in the proximity range)
